### **FedRAMP Moderate Analysis**
```json
{
  "compliance_summary": {
    "total_controls": 11,
    "passed_controls": 6,
    "failed_controls": 1,
    "partial_controls": 4,
    "compliance_percentage": 54.5,
    "average_confidence": 77.4
  }
}
```

### **AI Recommendations Example**
```
ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Compliance Analysis

Based on analysis of 11 controls, your overall compliance rate is 54.5%.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES - Immediate Action Required:
â€¢ AC-2 (Account Management):
  - Users without MFA: bob
  - Enable MFA for all users

 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
â€¢ Multi-Factor Authentication: Implement MFA for all users immediately
