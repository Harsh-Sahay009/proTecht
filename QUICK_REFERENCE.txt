COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: "What does proTecht do?"
A: "proTecht is a cybersecurity compliance automation platform that validates
   System Security Plans (SSPs) against system configuration data across
   multiple compliance frameworks including FedRAMP, NIST, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS.
   It provides real-time compliance analysis with AI-powered recommendations."

Q: "How does the compliance checking work?"
A: "The system uses a two-stage approach: SSP analysis and AWS validation.
   Each control gets scored on SSP description quality (0-100%) and AWS
   implementation validation (0-100%). The average determines overall
   compliance status (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)."

Q: "What's the architecture of your application?"
A: "It's a Flask-based web application with embedded frontend. The backend
   handles SSP parsing, compliance checking, and AI recommendations through
   RESTful APIs. The frontend provides an interactive interface with
   real-time updates and file upload capabilities."

Q: "How do you handle different compliance frameworks?"
A: "Each framework has its own control patterns (regex) and compliance rules
   stored in a FRAMEWORKS dictionary. The system dynamically loads
   framework-specific logic and applies appropriate scoring algorithms
   for each standard."

Q: "What security measures did you implement?"
A: "Multiple layers: file type validation (whitelist), size limits (16MB),
   secure filename handling, automatic cleanup, encoding validation,
   input sanitization, and proper error handling."

Q: "How scalable is your solution?"
A: "The current MVP is designed for demonstration. For production, I'd add
   database storage, caching, background processing, microservices
   architecture, and real AWS API integration for enterprise-scale deployment."

Q: "What technologies did you use and why?"
A: "Flask for rapid development and simplicity, Python for data processing
   capabilities, embedded frontend for quick prototyping, and modern CSS
   for professional presentation. The single-file approach demonstrates
   clean architecture and maintainable code."

Q: "How do you parse SSP documents?"
A: "Using regex patterns specific to each framework to identify controls
   in the SSP text. The parse_ssp() function iterates through control
   patterns, extracts descriptions, and returns structured data for
   compliance analysis."

Q: "What's the scoring algorithm?"
A: "Two-dimensional scoring: SSP score based on implementation detail
   and keyword presence, AWS score based on actual configuration
   validation. Overall score is the average, determining compliance status."

Q: "How do you handle file uploads?"
A: "Secure file handling with type validation, size limits, secure
   filename processing, text extraction with encoding fallback,
   and automatic cleanup after processing."

Q: "What makes your UI professional?"
A: "Modern design with glass-morphism effects, responsive layout,
   smooth animations, interactive elements, real-time updates,
   and mobile-friendly interface."

DEMO SCRIPT FOR INTERVIEWS
================================================================================

1. OPENING (30 seconds):
   "Let me show you proTecht, a cybersecurity compliance automation platform
   that validates System Security Plans against system configuration data."

2. FRAMEWORK SELECTION (1 minute):
   "Notice the framework selector - we support 4 major standards:
   FedRAMP, NIST, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS. Each has its own control
   patterns and compliance rules."

3. FILE UPLOAD (1 minute):
   "Users can upload SSP documents or paste text directly.
   The system processes files securely with validation and cleanup."

4. ANALYSIS (1 minute):
   "Watch the real-time analysis - we parse the SSP, check compliance
   against AWS data, and provide instant results with scoring."

5. INTERACTIVE CONTROLS (1 minute):
   "Click on any control to see detailed findings and recommendations.
   Each control shows SSP score, AWS score, and overall confidence."

6. AI RECOMMENDATIONS (1 minute):
   "The AI analyzes all results and provides strategic recommendations
   for compliance improvement."

7. CLOSING (30 seconds):
   "This demonstrates full-stack development with security focus,
   modern UI/UX, and enterprise-grade functionality."
